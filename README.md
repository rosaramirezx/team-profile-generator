## Installation

1. Navigate in your Terminal to where you want the repository to lie and run `git clone https://github.com/jesterb0206/team-profile-generator.git`.
2. In order to download the packages and dependencies `cd` into the `team-profile-generator` folder and run `npm install`.

## Usage

1. In the command-line terminal, navigate to the `team-profile-generator` folder if you're not there already. Then run `node index.js`. You'll be asked to enter the manager's name, employee ID, email address and office number.
2. Next, you'll be asked if you want to add an "engineer" or "intern" to your team. If so, answer the following prompted questions.
3. When you're all done select "finished." An `index.html` file will be created in the `dist` folder.

## Tests

Testing is key to making code maintainable, so for this Node.js command-line application I wrote unit tests for each part of my code and ensured that it passed all of them. The unit tests were written using the JavaScript framework Jest, and they can be found in the "**test**" folder of my repository.
